# Delish - Save your bookmarks

Delish is a bookmarks saving web app that lets you organise your saved links with collections and tags.

## Rationale

I originally built a similar application as my Capstone project for Havard's [CS50w](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). You can see what it looked like and how it worked on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drs3QUh3-XY .
For academic reasons I can't share the source code of my final project (that would invalidate my [certification](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/62bff0629c59455da7839cb5a1fd213f/)), and so I decided to rebuild the app from scratch, with some adjustments and some different technologies.

## Building in public

I'm building the app in public, you can follow my progress on my personal website: https://www.mauromotion.com/tags/delish/
